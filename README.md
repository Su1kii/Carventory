**Carventory** is a full-stack car inventory management app where users can **add, edit, view, and delete** their vehicles. It showcases my abilities in full-stack development using modern technologies like **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Prisma** — backed by a Neon Postgres database and Stack Auth for authentication.
